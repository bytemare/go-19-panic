# go-19-panic
This repo explores an internal Go compiler panic in 1.19 that did not occur in 1.18.

The code is an extract from another project ([github.com/bytemare/crypto]()), and I simplified it to have a minimum of code left that reproduces the panic.

`go test` from the root produces the following output:

```
$ go test
# go-19-panic [go-19-panic.test]
<autogenerated>:1: internal compiler error: panic: runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference

Please file a bug report including a short program that triggers the error.
https://go.dev/issue/new
FAIL    go-19-panic [build failed]
FAIL
```

It worked on 1.18, and is reproducible in CI (see GitHub Action).
